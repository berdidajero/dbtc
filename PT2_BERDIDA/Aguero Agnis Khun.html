		<h1>Aguero Agnis Khun</h1>
			<p>Often referred to simply as "Khun", is a C-Rank Regular from Khun Family. He is a best friend of Twenty-Fifth Baam, one of the main protagonists of Tower of God.
				He is one of many "defected sons" of Khun Eduan. He was expelled from his family because his older sister failed to become one of Zahard's Princesses. He teamed up with Baam and Rak and passed multiple tests with them. He was assigned the Light Bearer position and showed clear talent in the field. He is a highly cunning Regular, who manipulates rules of tests to suit his needs
